# Django AWS Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for the Skipify Django project. It is built using React and is the interface for the Skipify Django Backend container.

## Features

The current version of the frontend is functional and provides the following features:

- User authentication
- View current boycotted artists
- Add new artist to boycott
- Remove artist from boycott list (ideally once they've redeemed themselves) 

## Planned Features

In future updates, I plan to add the following features to enhance the functionality and experience:

- User Registration Page!! It's my first priority when i switch back to this project.
- Show currently playing track with the ability to add an artist to the boycott list.
- rework the whole navigation to provide a better experience. There are a few navigation bugs due to the way I check the address bar instead of using react routers or something. More info needed here, but the experience needs an overhaul.
